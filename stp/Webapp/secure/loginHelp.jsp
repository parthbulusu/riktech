STP stands for Smart Troubleshooting Package and is a pervasive, online troubleshooting guide for networking engineers. Built as an Enterprise Productivity enhancement tool for Customer support and Quality Assurance Engineers, the STP augments the end user’s skill sets by equipping them with an additional wealth of troubleshooting knowledge-base. The built-in knowledge-database along with an interactive &amp; easy to use front end interface help users to cut down time to resolve simple to complex networking issues. It enables speedier identification of root cause of issues and thus quickens resolution for Networking engineers with varying levels of Technology level troubleshooting skills sets.

STP can be used in two modes of operation to improve productivity:
</p>
<ol>
	<li style="font-weight:bold;">Technology  Module:</li>
		<span>This Module is a comprehensive, per Networking Technology, in depth troubleshooting guide.  When the users of the STP system, understand the specific Networking Technology boundaries within which the real-life problem is bound, this module helps the users to do a quick but thorough troubleshooting in that domain to pin point the issue. Technology areas cover Routing &amp; Switching, Security, Virtualization and Data Center categories to name a few. Easy sub-classification lookup within the Technology areas make it friendly for end users to locate information in a few clicks.</span>
	<li style="font-weight:bold;">Business Solutions Module:</li>
		<span>This Module is a compilation of Common problems and Often implemented solutions, we have gathered over years of Networking deployment &amp; testing expertise. When the user of the STP system, doesn’t know which Technology areas to start with for the network level troubleshooting their real-life issues, they could use these solutions as a starting point in their efforts.  The user is guided through a series of simple and interactive steps right from the beginning to the problem identification state, taking the guess work out of the trouble shooting to increase productivity and result in saving critical time and money. As an Example,  Business Solutions that start with a Enterprise Branch or Campus or MDS topological abstraction with users being able to narrow down the topological scope further to isolate the problem nodes within that topology, prior to narrowing down to the Technology suspected to be at fault.</span>
