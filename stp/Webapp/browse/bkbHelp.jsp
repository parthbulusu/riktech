			Technology trouble shooting module of STP helps an engineer to resolve
			and/or learn a specific networking technology through a series of
			guided question and answer sessions driven by a simple and intuitive
			user interface. <b>It is assumed that a user in this mode is aware
				that:</b>
			<ol style="margin: 0 0 0 0">
				<li>A specific networking technology has led him/her to a
					trouble-ticket that he/she needs to resolve quickly <b>or</b>
				</li>
				<li>The user is interested in getting trained on the basics
					and/or advanced trouble shooting techniques related to a specific
					networking technology
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p id="subText1">
				Needless to say there are many networking technologies used in public
				and private networks. Further, each technology may focus on various
				sub-technologies. For example, a technology could be <b>"Security"</b>
				that broadly deals with a suite of protocols/software that deals with
				various security aspects of public and private networks. On the other
				hand, a sub-technology within the "Security" technology is "<b>VPN
					(Virtual Private Networks)</b>". In this scenario, STP will help in
				training or resolving issues related to establishing VPN tunnels using
				tunneling protocols such as PPTP/L2TP or encryption protocols using
				IPSec.

				Thus, <b>Technology Trouble Shooting</b> module within STP is a great
				productivity enhancement tool to quickly resolve or get trained on a
				specific technologies. Thus, it helps in resolving issues a bit
				quicker while saving increasing the profitability.
